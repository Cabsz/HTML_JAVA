            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hi! my name is Calvin Da Anunciacao. I am going to <b>New England Institute of Technology</b> for <i>CyberSecurity and Networking</i>. I am not sure what exactly I want to do, but I know it has to do in the I.T field so im happy to discover it as I learn. I live in Massachusetts and have to comute 40 minutes to get to class, alot of time through Providence traffic. My family is <u>portuguese</u> and I will often travel to Portugal to visit family I have that lives there. I have a spoiled cat who is a bit chunky since we were gone for a couple weeks on our vacation. And thats a little bit about me.</p>

            <p>New England Institute of Technology, or <b>NEIT</b> is a University in Rhode Island that I am currently attending. My brother is soon to be an alumni at NEIT, and was the one who recommended the University to me when I decided that I wanted to pursue the field of <i>Cybersecurity and Networking</i>. Before that, I had attended Diman regional, which is a vocational school that had allowed students to engage in "co-op" where they can go into the field of their tech choice in a actual job, while working in school. After that, I had attended <u>Bristol Community College</u> for about a year and a half before Covid hit. I left the college, and for almost 2 years, focused more on my job than my education, trying to think of what I wanted to do in the futire for a career. After building my pc, and gaining interest in how computers work and connect, I decided to attend NEIT to one day join the field of Cybersecurity and Networking.</p>

            <p>I spend most of my freetime playing video games. I have a PS2,3,4 psp and vita, a xbox one, nintendo Wii, Wii U, and switch, and a <b>pc that I built myself</b> last year in june. While I do have favorite games I do play, they tend to change depending on what I am most interested in at the time, or how many of my friends are playing it. The actual sport soccer, not video game, I enjoy greatly. While I was in middle school, I participated in <i>Futsal</i>, or indoor soccer, for about 6 out of my 8 years there. I do have a favorite team, that being Benfica from the Primeira League in Portugal. Finally, what I like to spend my time doing the most is hanging out with my <u>friends or my cousins</u>, whether that's going to amusement parks, or resturants, it's how I like to enjoy spending my free time the most.</p>
