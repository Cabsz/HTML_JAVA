                <p><em>The Sixth Sense</em> is one of my favorite movies that I have seen. The cast is full of many famous celebrities such as Bruce Willis from the popular Die Hard films or Haley Joel Osment from <em>Forest Gump</em> The producer and writer is famed M Night Shyamala, who is known for making thrillers and films with twists within them, and this film is not short on that. Within the first 5 minutes of the film, we are already captivated with curiosity for the events that transpire, when Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is shot by a failed patient Vincent (Donnie Wahlberg), who then proceeds to kill himself, leaving Malcolms wife to panic while the screen fades to black. It does a great job at capturing our attention, and it does not drop that, as strange events occur in the film that gets revealed for a big payout towards the end of the movie.</p>

                <p>The film has proven itself to be wildly successful as well, with the budget for the film at around $40 million, and a box office release of $672.8 million, and for good reason. The movie does an excellent job at keeping you invested in the characters that it is portraying. Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a child who seems like he can't get along with his classmates, ends up seeing the child psychologist Malcolm Crowe to help him with his problems. He confides in Malcolm, and tells him that he can see dead people. While this does make us, the viewers, interested in seeing how this plays out, the film actually does an incredible job at foreshadowing with this one line, which comes to fruition at the end of the film, once Malcolm finally pieces all the pieces together. This film is a classic, and although I haven't seen it in about a decade, I can still recall most scenes from the film in vivid detail, as the reveal to the twist that makes all the little strange happenings finally make sense, shocked me to where I cannot forget it.</p>

                    <li>Did you know that the actor for Victor, Donnie Wahlberg, is actually the older brother of Mark Wahlberg, as well as a founding member of <em>New Kids on the Block?</em></li>
                    <li>Donnie Wahlberg actually 43 pounds in order to play the character Vincent in the film.</li>
                    <li>To keep viewers in the dark about Malcolm, Willis who was left handed, learned how to write and draw with his right hand so that viewers wouldn't notice that his wedding band was no longer on his left hand.</li>
