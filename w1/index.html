    <p>Hi! my name is Calvin Da Anunciacao. I am going to <b>New England Institute of Technology</b> for <i>CyberSecurity and Networking</i>. I am not sure what exactly I want to do, but I know it has to do in the I.T field so im happy to discover it as I learn. I live in Massachusetts and have to comute 40 minutes to get to class, alot of time through <u>Providence traffic</u>. My family is portuguese and I will often travel to Portugal to visit family I have that lives there. I have a spoiled cat who is a bit chunky since we were gone for a couple weeks on our vacation. And thats a little bit about me.</p>
